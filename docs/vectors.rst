Vectors
=======

Vectors are a crucial part of working with picraft; sufficiently important to
demand their own section. This chapter introduces all the major vector
operations with simple examples and diagrams illustrating the results.

Orientation
===========

Vectors represent a position or direction within the Minecraft world. The
Minecraft world uses a `right-hand coordinate system`_ where the Y axis is
vertical, and Z represents depth. You can think of positive Z values as
pointing "out of" the screen, while negative Z values point "into" the screen.

If you ever have trouble remembering the orientation label the thumb, index
finger, and middle finger of your right hand as X, Y, Z respectively. Raise
your hand so that Y (the index finger) is pointing up. Now spread your thumb
and middle finger so they're at right angles to each other and your index
finger, and you'll have the correct orientation of Minecraft's coordinate
system.

The following illustration shows the directions of each of the axes:

Positive rotation in Minecraft also follows the `right-hand rule`_. For
example, positive rotation about the Y axis proceeds anti-clockwise along the
X-Z plane. Again, this is easy to see by applying the rule: make a fist with
your right hand, then point the thumb vertically (positive direction along the
Y axis). Your other fingers now indicate the positive direction of rotation
around that axis.

Vector-vector operations
========================

The picraft :class:`~picraft.vector.Vector` class is extremely flexible and
supports a wide variety of operations. All Python's built-in operations
(addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, modulus, absolute, bitwise
operations, etc.) are supported between two vectors, in which case the
operation is performed element-wise. In other words, adding two vectors ``A``
and ``B`` produces a new vector with its ``x`` attribute set to ``A.x + B.x``,
its ``y`` attribute set to ``A.y + B.y`` and so on::

    >>> from picraft import *
    >>> Vector(1, 1, 0) + Vector(1, 0, 1)
    Vector(x=2, y=1, z=1)

.. image:: images/vector1.*
    :align: center

Likewise for subtraction, multiplication, etc.::

    >>> p = Vector(1, 2, 3)
    >>> q = Vector(3, 2, 1)
    >>> p - q
    Vector(x=-2, y=0, z=2)
    >>> p * q
    Vector(x=3, y=4, z=3)
    >>> p % q
    Vector(x=1, y=0, z=0)

.. image:: images/vector2.*
    :align: center

Vector-scalar operations
========================

Vectors also support several operations between themselves and a scalar value.
In this case the operation with the scalar is applied to each element of the
vector. For example, multiplying a vector by the number 2 will return a new
vector with every element of the original multiplied by 2::

    >>> p * 2
    Vector(x=2, y=4, z=6)
    >>> p + 2
    Vector(x=3, y=4, z=5)
    >>> p // 2
    Vector(x=0, y=1, z=1)

.. image:: images/vector3.*
    :align: center

Miscellaneous function support
==============================

Vectors also support several of Python's built-in functions::

    >>> abs(Vector(-1, 0, 1))
    Vector(x=1, y=0, z=1)
    >>> pow(Vector(1, 2, 3), 2)
    Vector(x=1, y=4, z=9)
    >>> import math
    >>> math.trunc(Vector(1.5, 2.3, 3.7))
    Vector(x=1, y=2, z=3)

Vector rounding
===============

Some built-in functions can't be directly supported, in which case equivalently
named methods are provided::

    >>> p = Vector(1.5, 2.3, 3.7)
    >>> p.round()
    Vector(x=2, y=2, z=4)
    >>> p.ceil()
    Vector(x=2, y=3, z=4)
    >>> p.floor()
    Vector(x=1, y=2, z=3)

.. image:: images/vector4.*
    :align: center

.. hint::

    Floor rounding is the method Minecraft uses to convert from a player
    position to a tile position. Floor rounding may look like truncation, aka
    "round toward zero", but becomes different when negative numbers are
    involved.

Short-cuts
==========

Several vector short-hands are also provided. One for the unit vector along
each of the three axes (X, Y, and Z), one for the origin (O), and finally V
which is simply a short-hand for Vector itself. Obviously, these can be used
to simplify many vector-related operations::

    >>> X
    Vector(x=1, y=0, z=0)
    >>> X + Y
    Vector(x=1, y=1, z=0)
    >>> p = V(1, 2, 3)
    >>> p + X
    Vector(x=2, y=2, z=3)
    >>> p + 2 * Y
    Vector(x=1, y=6, z=3)

.. image:: images/vector5.*
    :align: center

Rotation
========

From the paragraphs above it should be relatively easy to see how one can
implement vector translation and vector scaling using everyday operations like
addition, subtraction, multiplication and divsion. The third major
transformation usually required of vectors, `rotation`_, is a little harder.
For this, the :meth:`~picraft.vector.Vector.rotate` method is provided. This
takes two mandatory arguments: the number of degrees to rotate, and a vector
specifying the axis about which to rotate (it is recommended that this is
specified as a keyword argument for code clarity). For example::

    >>> p = V(1, 2, 3)
    >>> p.rotate(90, about=X)
    Vector(x=1.0, y=-3.0, z=2.0)
    >>> p.rotate(180, about=Y)
    Vector(x=-0.9999999999999997, y=2, z=-3.0)
    >>> p.rotate(180, about=Y).round()
    Vector(x=-1.0, y=2.0, z=-3.0)

.. image:: images/vector6.*
    :align: center

::

    >>> X.rotate(180, about=X + Y).round()
    Vector(x=-0.0, y=1.0, z=-0.0)

.. image:: images/vector7.*
    :align: center

A third optional argument to rotate, *origin*, permits rotation about an
arbitrary line. When specified, the axis of rotation passes through the point
specified by *origin* and runs in the direction of the axis specified by
*about*. Naturally, *origin* defaults to the origin (0, 0, 0)::

    >>> (2 * Y).rotate(180, about=Y, origin=2 * X).round()
    Vector(x=4.0, y=2.0, z=0.0)
    >>> O.rotate(90, about=Y, origin=X).round()
    Vector(x=1.0, y=0.0, z=1.0)

.. image:: images/vector8.*
    :align: center

To aid in certain kinds of rotation, the
:meth:`~picraft.vector.Vector.angle_between` method can be used to determine
the angle between two vectors (in the plane common to both)::

    >>> X.angle_between(Y)
    90.0
    >>> p = V(1, 2, 3)
    >>> X.angle_between(p)
    74.498640433063

.. image:: images/vector9.*
    :align: center

Magnitudes
==========

The :attr:`~picraft.vector.Vector.magnitude` attribute can be used to determine
the length of a vector (via `Pythagoras' theorem`_), while the
:attr:`~picraft.vector.Vector.unit` attribute can be used to obtain a vector in
the same direction with a magnitude (length) of 1.0. The
:meth:`~picraft.vector.Vector.distance_to` method can also be used to calculate
the distance between two vectors (this is simply equivalent to the magnitude of
the vector obtained by subtracting one vector from the other)::

    >>> p = V(1, 2, 3)
    >>> p.magnitude
    3.7416573867739413
    >>> p.unit
    Vector(x=0.2672612419124244, y=0.5345224838248488, z=0.8017837257372732)
    >>> p.unit.magnitude
    1.0
    >>> q = V(2, 0, 1)
    >>> p.distance_to(q)
    3.0

Dot and cross products
======================

The `dot`_ and `cross`_ products of a vector with another can be calculated
using the :meth:`~picraft.vector.Vector.dot` and
:meth:`~picraft.vector.Vector.cross` methods respectively. These are useful for
determining whether vectors are `orthogonal`_ (the dot product of orthogonal
vectors is always 0), for finding a vector perpendicular to the plane of two
vectors (via the cross product), or for finding the volume of a parallelepiped
defined by three vectors, via the `triple product`_::

    >>> p = V(x=2)
    >>> q = V(z=-1)
    >>> p.dot(q)
    0
    >>> r = p.cross(q)
    >>> r
    Vector(x=0, y=2, z=0)
    >>> area_of_pqr = p.cross(q).dot(r)
    >>> area_of_pqr
    4

    :align: center

Projection
==========

The final method provided by the :class:`~picraft.vector.Vector` class is
:meth:`~picraft.vector.Vector.project` which implements `scalar projection`_.
You might think of this as calculating the length of the shadow one vector
casts upon another. Or, put another way, this is the length of one vector
in the direction of another (unit) vector::

    >>> p = V(1, 2, 3)
    >>> p.project(X)
    1.0
    >>> q = X + Z
    >>> p.project(q)
    2.82842712474619
    >>> r = q.unit * p.project(q)
    >>> r.round(4)
    Vector(x=2.0, y=0.0, z=2.0)

Immutability
============

Vectors in picraft (in contrast to the Vec3 class in mcpi) are immutable. This
simply means that you cannot change the X, Y, or Z coordinate of an existing
vector::

    >>> v = Vector(1, 2, 3)
    >>> v.x += 1
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: can't set attribute
    >>> v.x = 2
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: can't set attribute

Given that nearly every standard operation can be applied to the vector itself,
this isn't a huge imposition::

    >>> v + X
    Vector(x=2, y=2, z=3)
    >>> v += X
    >>> v
    Vector(x=2, y=2, z=3)

Nevertheless, it may seem like an arbitrary restriction. However, it conveys an
extremely important capability in Python: only immutable objects may be keys of
a :class:`dict` or members of a :class:`set`. Hence, in picraft, a dict can be
used to represent the state of a portion of the world by mapping vectors to
block types, and set operators can be used to trivially determine regions.

For example, consider two vector ranges. We can convert them to sets and use
the standard set operators to determine all vectors that occur in both ranges,
and in one but not the other::

    >>> vr1 = vector_range(O, V(5, 0, 5) + 1)
    >>> vr1 = vector_range(O, V(2, 0, 5) + 1)
    >>> vr2 = vector_range(O, V(5, 0, 2) + 1)
    >>> set(vr1) & set(vr2)
    set([Vector(x=0, y=0, z=2), Vector(x=1, y=0, z=0), Vector(x=2, y=0, z=2),
    Vector(x=0, y=0, z=1), Vector(x=1, y=0, z=1), Vector(x=0, y=0, z=0),
    Vector(x=2, y=0, z=1), Vector(x=1, y=0, z=2), Vector(x=2, y=0, z=0)])
    >>> set(vr1) - set(vr2)
    set([Vector(x=1, y=0, z=3), Vector(x=1, y=0, z=4), Vector(x=2, y=0, z=4),
    Vector(x=1, y=0, z=5), Vector(x=0, y=0, z=5), Vector(x=0, y=0, z=4),
    Vector(x=2, y=0, z=3), Vector(x=2, y=0, z=5), Vector(x=0, y=0, z=3)])

.. image:: images/regions1.*
    :align: center

We could use a dict to store the state of the world for one of the ranges::

    >>> d = {v: b for (v, b) in zip(vr1, world.blocks[vr1])}

We can then manipulate this using dict comprehensions. For example, to modify
the dict to shift all vectors right by two blocks::

    >>> d = {v + 2*X: b for (v, b) in d.items()}

Or to rotate the vectors by 45 degrees about the Y axis::

    >>> d = {v.rotate(45, about=Y).round(): b for (v, b) in d.items()}

It is also worth noting to that due to their nature, sets and dicts
automatically eliminate duplicated coordinates. This can be useful for
efficiency, but in some cases (such as the rotation above), can be something to
watch out for.
