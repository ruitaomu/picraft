The world module defines the :class:`World` class, which is the usual way of
starting a connection to a Minecraft server and which then provides various
attributes allowing the user to query and manipulate that world.

.. note::

    All items in this module are available from the :mod:`picraft` namespace
    without having to import :mod:`picraft.world` directly.

The following items are defined in the module:

        This property can be queried to determine the type of a block in the
        world, or can be set to alter the type of a block. The property can be
        indexed with a single :class:`~picraft.vector.Vector`, in which case
        the state of a single block is returned (or updated) as a
        :class:`~picraft.block.Block` object::

            >>> world.blocks[g.player.tile_pos]
            <Block "grass" id=2 data=0>

        Alternatively, a slice of vectors can be used. In this case, when
        querying the property, a sequence of :class:`~picraft.block.Block`
        objects is returned, When setting a slice of vectors you can either
        pass a sequence of :class:`~picraft.block.Block` objects or a single
        :class:`~picraft.block.Block` object::

            >>> world.blocks[Vector(0,0,0):Vector(2,1,1)]
            [<Block "grass" id=2 data=0>,<Block "grass" id=2 data=0>]
            >>> world.blocks[Vector(0,0,0):Vector(5,1,5)] = Block.from_name('grass')

        As with normal Python slices, the interval specified is `half-open`_.
        That is to say, it is inclusive of the lower vector, *exclusive* of the
        upper one. Hence, ``Vector():Vector(x=5,1,1)`` represents the
        coordinates (0,0,0) to (4,0,0). It is usually useful to specify the
        upper bound as the vector you want and then add one to it::

            >>> world.blocks[Vector():Vector(x=1) + 1]
            [<Block "grass" id=2 data=0>,<Block "grass" id=2 data=0>]
            >>> world.blocks[Vector():Vector(4,0,4) + 1] = Block.from_name('grass')

        .. _half-open: http://python-history.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/why-python-uses-0-based-indexing.html

        Finally, you can query an arbitrary collection of vectors. In this case
        a sequence of blocks will be returned in the same order as the
        collection of vectors. You can also use this when setting blocks::

            >>> d = {
            ...     Vector(): Block('air'),
            ...     Vector(x=1): Block('air'),
            ...     Vector(z=1): Block('stone'),
            ...     }
            >>> l = list(d)
            >>> l
            [<Vector x=0, y=0, z=0>,<Vector x=1, y=0, z=0>,<Vector x=0, y=0, z=1>]
            >>> world.blocks[l]
            [<Block "grass" id=2 data=0>,<Block "grass" id=2 data=0>,<Block "grass" id=2 data=0>]
            >>> world.blocks[d.keys()] = d.values()

        .. warning::

            Querying or setting sequences of blocks can be extremely slow as a
            network transaction must be executed for each individual block.
            When setting a slice of blocks, this can be speeded up by
            specifying a single :class:`~picraft.block.Block` in which case one
            network transaction will occur to set all blocks in the slice.  The
            Raspberry Juice server also supports querying sequences of blocks
            with a single command (picraft will automatically use this).
            Additionally, :meth:`~picraft.connection.Connection.batch_start`
            can be used to speed up setting sequences of blocks (though not
            querying).
